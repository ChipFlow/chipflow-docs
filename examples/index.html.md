# ChipFlow Examples

The [chipflow-examples](https://github.com/ChipFlow/chipflow-examples) repository contains example designs demonstrating how to build chips using the ChipFlow platform.

These examples show you how to:

- Structure a ChipFlow project
- Configure your design with `chipflow.toml`
- Run simulations to test your design
- Submit your design to the ChipFlow cloud builder

## Available Examples

**Minimal SoC** ([Minimal SoC Example](minimal.md))
: A minimal System-on-Chip with a RISC-V core. This is the simplest starting point for understanding ChipFlow projects.

**MCU SoC** ([MCU SoC Example](mcu-soc.md))
: A more complete MCU-style SoC with additional peripherals. Demonstrates a more realistic design with GPIO, UART, and other interfaces.

## Getting Started

See [Getting Started with ChipFlow Examples](getting-started.md) for instructions on how to clone the examples repository and run your first chip build.
